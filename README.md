# python-projects
Some of my coding projects written in Python.

To run them all you need is a simple IDE. The easiest and most basic python IDE is probably IDLE (Comes with python), however if you wish to expand upon that you can use Notepad++
Personally, I use Visual Studio Code as it allows autofill and extensions for all type of coding languages (like Notepadd++) and you can also see errors and descriptions why, ontop of this the design is much nicer and it's allows you to see the current directory and more in the side menu.
